<h2> Inspiration </h2>
<p>Our inspiration for this project was that because of the pandemic we don't have the opportunity to get to know their teacher. This can lead to people taking classes with bad teachers, our project would allow people to rate local teachers so people know which ones to take classes with and which ones to avoid.</p>
<p>In addition, during the pandemic, we have seen an increasing demand from parents and students to seek great local teachers who are willing to provide online assistance or after-school classes to develop extracurricular strengths. </p>
<p>More importantly, teachers are facing an extremely difficult economical situation during the pandemic. We would love to build an online platform for students and teachers to find each other without the limit on locations. </p>
<p>To this end, we are developing a platform where students are able to find the best teachers who teach a certain discipline they want to improve on and teachers are able to advertise for themselves to earn more and survive through the pandemic.</p>
<h2> What it does</h2>
<p>First of all, a user can see teachers and schools based on their names, disciplines, and their ratings. A user can search a teacher/school by searching their name as a keyword or filtering based on the discipline a teacher/school teaches. Furthermore, teachers/schools are displayed in descending order from high ratings to low ratings. </p>
<p>Secondly, a user can learn more about a teacher/school by clicking on this teacher/school's own page. On this page, a user will be able to see the teacher/school's name, discipline, and overall rating. A user can also see the teacher/school's bio, including the location/school and the number of teaching experiences. The rating is **live**, which means once a user submits a new review with a rating, the rating will change immediately to reflect the latest results. A user is able to submit a review with a rating on a teacher/school's page.  Review submission is also **live**, which means once a user submits a new review, the review will immediately show up on the website. A user can also browse reviews by selecting either from descending order to time a review is submitted or from descending order to ratings. </p>
<h2> How we built it</h2>
<p>The website is built using  <i>React<i/>  framework with <i>Javascript<i/>, <i>HTML<i/>, and <i>CSS<i/>. To design the frontend of the website, we used <i>Emotion<i/>, <i>Material-UI<i/>, and <i>React-DOM<i/>. To store data on the backend, we used nonSQL <i>Hasura<i/>, <i>Heroku<i/>, and <i>GraphQL<i/>. To manage routes and build a RESTful backend, we used <i>Apollo<i/> and <i>React-router<i/>. We deployed our website on <i>Netlify<i/>.</p>
<h2> Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
<p>Firstly, we are proud of making progress to solve an urgent problem existing both locally and nationally for students and teachers. We believe that this website will provide a better and smoother match between students and teachers, facilitate the teaching quality of teachers and schools, enhancing connections among students, among teachers, between students and teachers.</p>
<p>Secondly, as a group of beginners, we are learning along the way. Our team members learned to use Github, React, HTML, CSS, etc for the first time.</p>
<p>We are proud that we figured out how to make the search bar and that we were able to sort the reviews and add star ratings.</p>
<h2> What's next for Schelp</h2>
<p>To make this website helpful for students and teachers, we plan to advertise and market the website locally first within our neighborhood, communities, and schools. We will invite users to test our website and publish reviews, rate schools/teachers and browse information. For features, we would love to add the following:</p>
<p>Firstly, we would love to add the function for users to add more teachers'/schools' information such that teachers and schools are not just managed on the backend but also edited by users. This will be a more collective process for all users so that we will be able to collect more information.</p>
<p>Secondly, we would love to add the function for users to edit teachers'/schools' bio on their separate pages so that students and teachers will be able to share additional information than what we have collected so far. Again, this will be a more collective process for all users that the more information is shared, the better.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we would love to add the function for users to comment on, like, and share reviews. We believe this interactive function will be important for students and parents to share information with each other.</p>
<h2> Getting Started with Create React App</h2>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More
